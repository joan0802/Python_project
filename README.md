## Python Project Folder
This folder serves to document Python practices and course projects.

### Accounting Program:
- Developed user-friendly functions for tasks such as entry addition, deletion, and total expense calculation.
- Implemented robust error handling using try-except and raise tools for improved code debuggability and maintainability.

### Path Simulation:
- Bonus project for the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) course.
- Used Matplotlib to simulate the path of a dog in the context of a specific ODE problem.
